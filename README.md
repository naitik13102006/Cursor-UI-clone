# Cursor Landing Page Clone

This project is a front-end recreation of the Cursor official landing page UI, built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The objective was to closely match the original website’s layout, spacing, typography, and dark-themed visual style while keeping the implementation simple and framework-free.
